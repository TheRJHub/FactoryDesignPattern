Factory Method Design Pattern
----------------------------
--> The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class.

--> The class that needs an object asks a factory method to give it one.

--> The factory method decides which class to instantiate.

--> Useful when we have different types of objects but want to treat them the same way through a common interface.

Why we use it:
--------------
--> Avoids direct dependency on concrete classes.

--> Makes adding new types easier.

--> Centralizes object creation in one place.
